		<h2 class="about_me">A bit about me:</h2>
		  
		<p class="bio">
		  I'm a computer science and product design graduate from University of Canterbury. <br><br>
		  I'm interested in the low end of the computer science and Product Design domains, initially embarking on my life of higher
		  education to play with robots/prosthetics. I started looking at Mechatronics engineering, but quickly
		  decided that was not the route for me, moving towards a computer science and product design pathway in 
		  my intermediate year. This route has left me in a very exciting situation and I can't wait to see
		  where I end up! 
		  
		  <br><br>
		  Outside of study, I play Ice Hockey on a regular basis and also enjoy riding dirtbikes. 
		  I am also creative playing guitar from a young age this has led 
		  to the part composition of an Extended Play (EP). As well as being highly involved in the fine 
		  arts of painting and design, which is am musing to develop a game, in which I am doing the 
		  concept artwork for â€“ This is on the backburner because other priorities have taken place - 
		  but perhaps one day I will finish or meet others to join my project.</p>

  <h2 class="exploration">Extended study info and motives: </h2>
  Through Computer science I looked heavily into embedded systems - the raw programming and layout of a PCB - Deep/Machine Learning alongside UX, IoT (including mixed reality) and computer graphics for Python and C languages.
  <p class="motivation">

    Later in the course of my studies I completed a postgraduate diploma. This has left a window open for me to potentially continue on to get my<em> masters</em> after the competition of a thesis. 
      </p><p class="motivation"> 
    
    The intent behind my postgraduate specialisation was to cross computer science and embedded systems -  this is aso support  and with the backing of product design - revenues to cross with UX and applications of embedded systems for further development of <em>IoT and robotic/automated systems.</em>
    </p><p class="motivation">
    
    During my postgraduate studies I especially took interest in <em>Embedded Systems</em>, and <em>Deep Learning </em>- which has become a very broad topic recently ranging from <em>CV</em> (Computer Vision) to <em>NPL</em> (Natural Languages Processing) and Chatbots or any <em>Deep Learning solution </em>for nearly any other programming pipeline.
    </p><p class="motivation">
    
    Aspects relevant to these general fields are<em> OpenGL 4</em> for robotics control, this can include programming interfaces for robotic simulations - implementing physics based systems to allow preliminary developments and monitoring for real-time systems or remote controllability. This includes common animations riggings and robotics control methods seen in the robotics industry or computer oriented environments such as games and CGI. 
    </p><p class="motivation">
    
    The underlying foundation of my postgraduate degree followed<em> Multi-Threaded </em>and <em>Concurrent Programming</em>, this was with<em> RTOS </em>(Real-Time Operating Systems) and through <em>kernel level hardware</em> pressing over to supercomputing and distributed systems. The construction and design of a PCB is also a foundation of my embedded systems knowledge understanding the internal construction of the units, and their explicit applications. 
    </p><p class="motivation">
    
    These skills were used practically to produce a PCB and code it for its intended purpose. Testing out knowledge of<em> I2C, IR, COM </em>and various other analog and digital signal transmission protocols - competing against various groups with our constructed PCB and system.
