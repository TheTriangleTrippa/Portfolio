<h1 class="title">Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>

<h2 class="about_me">A bit about me:</h2>
  

  
<p class="bio">
  I'm a computer science and product design student graduate from University of Canterbury. 
  I'm interested in the low end of the computer science domain, initially embarking on my life of higher
  education to play with robots/prosthetics. I started looking at Mechatronics engineering, but quickly
  decided that was not the route for me, moving towards a computer science and product design pathway in 
  my intermediate year. This route has left me in a very exciting situation and I can't wait to see
  where I end up! 
  
  <br><br>
  Outside of study, I play Ice Hockey on a regular basis, and also enjoy riding dirtbikes. 
  Online side the extreme nature, I am also creative playing guitar from a young age this has led 
  to the part composition of an Extended Play (EP). As well as being highly involved in the fine 
  arts of painting and design, which is am musing to develop a game, in which I am doing the 
  concept artwork for â€“ This is on the backburner because other priorities have taken place - 
  but perhaps one day I will finish or meet others to join my project.</p>

<h2 class="exploration">Here are some branches to Design and Computer science:</h2>
  <p>Feel free to look at it all!</p>

  <h2> Extended study info and motives: </h2>
   <p class="motivation"> Later in the course of my studies I completed postgraduate degree, the intent was to cross between computer science and embedded systems. 
    This support the backing of product design, the intent was to cross to UX or the controlling of embedded systems for further development. 
    Surrounding these postgraduate studies my specialisations became more apparent to application of embedded system, and basic understand of 
    PCB construction and design, the underlying principles of producing and manufacturing a PCB, putting together a microcontroller in for remote 
    controlled vehicle through IR remote and accelerometer.  This is coupled with OpenGL, and multisystem computer processing of Parallel computing, 
    multithreading and distributed computing underlying the application of supercomputer construction and program implementation. I am capable of Machine 
    Learning programming over Computer vision, Natural Language Programming and other Machine learning applications.</p>
