          <p class="info">  THe first assignment completed was a design a chrildrens toy, while I streched the assignment abit to 
            allow for myself, a chilish man to paly with a sword in a battle royal.
            We were to concepulise a target market, investigate some avenues to presnt a toy for children, then design and prototype 
            throughout the development process following some defined specifications.

              <p class="discourse-disclaimer">IN this ssingmetn i had suffered a broken schphoid, and was unable to properly prototype and design throughout the year, 
                so some of the design work is limited. This means hat the final prototype, was less tested and not finsihed to the perfered standard. 
                Though the concept is there, there are a afew design odificatiosn htat could better allow for the product functionality. 
             </p> <p class="info"> 
                 We were then in our first year directed to designa nd product prottotypes of  products that were to aid hte 
                visually impaired with common complicaiotns that they may encounter throughtout their days.
                IN this scnce it was shopping, and identifying food in the cuboard how much ot there was and what each item is 
                - for this id eveloped a scanner, that was connected to a food chain.

                this utlised  a watch, that could scan inhouse items via the stuck onbarcode, to let the user know what things were.

   <p class="info">  I was assigned PLA to research and design with, his involved working to manufacture a prototype, working from recycled material sources. 
      This was our designed product, that ideally would be the final prodcut given proper manufacturig facilities. This was another group assignment, 
      presenting a model, promotional video and design package.

   <p class="info">  Designed a piece of playground equipment. Intially I had to design a exisitng piece of equipment - 
      this was more of a CAD exorcise. I was then required to design an entire piece using the full design process, this was a group activity, 
      presenting a full portfolio on completion.

  <p class="info"> 
   A waterclock utlising THermofluid dynamics was desinga nd manufacuted to mark a 5 mnute interval. 
   In this hte assingemtnw as a runa clok froma  water source and have it accurately time 5 minutes.
    IN this assingmetnw ere were not allwoed to use 3D-printed materials and were awarded points for style and funcitnality.

  <p class="info"> 
    a simple rachet mechnsuim was ued to control the roation of a water feed wheel, this in turn allowe for a tick at each rachet 
    of this wheel driving a clock face by a belt. There are signficantmy more feature in this design than first appears, and was
    completed through various fluid dynamic princples beign calcualted to achieve the dsiened output. This clock achieved 5 minutes with wheel and rachet were correclty aligned.

<p class="info"> Redesign of a folding chair. The first two are models of two chairs we had 
   as reference strcutures, these chairs where then used to redesign teh cair depending on our target market, which was a festival chair. The Third mopdel is the 2nd development of my design iterations.
   THe 4th model is our final design fitted with a cargo net.

   <p class="info"> The first third year project was to design a bike wall mount using flatpack fastenerless construction, this was designed to hold the weight of a bicycle 
    and was tested at the end of the assignment to specified Factor of saftey. The second assingmetn was to use FEA and Generative Design to develop this design to hold within 
    a specified weight limit at a defined FoS. In my instace I used generative design, alongsize FEA to determine mounting points and criticalr regions that would allow for
     the gernated bike mount to meet this defined prequsite.  The design was model with consdieration of a real bike to with weights to scale for testing. In this assingment, 
     I changed groups betwween phases 1 and 2 working froma differnt base point.

<p class="info"> In the second thrid year assignment a handheld electrical appliance was to be reesigned from scratch. This incoporated internal componetns that were outsourced, or developed alongside. 
  The asignmetn lead hevely into daftey, and project managmetn tehniques to ensure integirty of boh hte design process and the product for consumer applciations. working through developing hte mechaincal 
  systems in cecetulised work, and into the development inclusing CAD, and mechinical compents the finald design  was output meeeting the defined speficications.
</p><p class="discourse-disclaimer"> 
 In this assignment ther was internal trouble within the group, this was because hte other tema memeber didn;t present the required work to adequately support the project. 
  This was especially evident in the finalisation of the peoject, and can be seen in the overall qality and consistance the basis of the 
  seccond part of the assingmetn was completed by myself without any support from other emmebers of the group - this includedhte fulll development process fo the design, 
  final cad work and technical drawing packages as well as the bulk of the portfolio.
